# Unix_Shell

Objective:
The shell is the part of the Operating System with which a computer usually
interacts (Unix - Command Line interpreter). The shell provides an interface for the
User to run programs, execute commands and to manage files. The aim of the
project will be build a simple yet powerful shell that will run on the Unix/ Linux
System (Programming will be in C).

Implementation:
The shell will be written in C language. The knowledge of both C language and
POSIX System Calls is essential. Note that, usage of scripting in any form will not be
done as the project does not make use of any existing shell.
